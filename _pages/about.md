I am a third-year undergraduate at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu), on track to recieve my BSc in Applied and Computational Mathematics. My research interests lie in rigorously studying interacting particle systems, more specifically tooled for the purposes of optimization and on graphs. I have the pleasure of currently being mentored by [Prof. Franca Hoffmann](https://francahoffmann.com) in this research area.

Outside of academics, I am incredibly passionate about teaching, whether that be through serving as a teaching assistant (TA) for undergraduate classes or tutoring kids in the local Pasadena area. I firmly believe that improving the quality and accessibility of education is the first of many steps needed to fix the educational droughts present across the world. Please feel free to contact me at [rteegava@caltech.edu](mailto:rteegava@caltech.edu) with any and all teaching opportunities that are generally in the domain of applied mathematics!
