I am a second-year undergraduate at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu), on track to recieve my BSc in Applied and Computational Mathematics as well as a minor in Pure Mathematics. My research interests lie in using measure transport maps to solve inverse problems, and have the pleasure of currently being mentored by [Dr. Ricardo Baptista](https://www.ricardobaptista.com) in this research area. More broadly, I am interested in learning more about inverse problems and uncertainty quantification through the lens of probability theory. 

Outside of academics, I am incredibly passionate about teaching, whether that be through serving as a teaching assistant (TA) for undergraduate classes or tutoring kids in the local Pasadena area. I firmly believe that improving the quality and accessibility of education is the first of many steps needed to fix the educational droughts present across the world.   Please feel free to contact me at [rteegava@caltech.edu](mailto:rteegava@caltech.edu) with any and all teaching opportunities that are generally in the domain of applied mathematics!
