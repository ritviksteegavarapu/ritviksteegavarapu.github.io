This is an introductory class that discusses the introductory methods of computational science and engineering. In this class, we did a high-level overview of numerical methods for solving ODEs and PDEs, numerical linear algebra, optimization, uncertainty quantification, and function approximation. 

I was responsible for re-writing the problem sets for this class with the assistance of the post-doctoral scholar, attending lectures to help students in-person, as well as hosting weekly office hours. Overall, I got a ?/5.00 score in my evaluations as a TA.
