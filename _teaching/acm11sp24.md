This is a core class required for all incoming freshman (~225) that introduces students to proof-based mathematics via the lens of real analysis. In this class, we covered real numbers, sequences and series, continuity, limits, derivatives, integrals, and assorted topics while ensuring students thought critically when writing proofs out.

I was responsible for leading office hours weekly, hosting a recitation section in which content from the previous lectures were reviewed, as well as grading. Overall, I got a ?/5.00 score in my evaluations as a TA.
