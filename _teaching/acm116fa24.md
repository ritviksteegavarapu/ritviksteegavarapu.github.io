This is an applied mathematics class recommended for almost all STEM disciplines that introduces students to probability theory and stochastic processes. In this class, we studied random variables, expectation and variance, moment generating functions, conditioning, counting processes, Poisson processes, Brownian motion, as well as general properties such as stationarity and indpendence.

I was responsible for managing a team of 8 TAs, leading office hours weekly, hosting midterm and final reviews, answering questions on the class Piazza, as well as grading. Overall, I got a ?/5.00 score in my evaluations as a TA.
