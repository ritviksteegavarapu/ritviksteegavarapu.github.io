This is a advanced variant of a core class required for all incoming freshman (~125) that introduces students to proof-based linear algebra. In this class, we covered vectors, vector spaces, linear maps, isomorphisms, theory of matrices, inner products and norms, eigenvalues, diagonalization, and Jordan canonical form.

I was responsible for leading office hours weekly, hosting a recitation section in which content from the previous lectures were reviewed, as well as grading. Overall, I got a 4.94/5.00 score in my evaluations as a TA from 21 students.
